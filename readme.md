# Pulse CMS Languages

Language files for Pulse CMS. Please contribute and improve on these and download freely to use in your Pulse CMS projects. 

## Pulse5

Since Pulse 4.6, we have shipped Pulse with English, German and Japanese. Pulse5 will ship with these also plus anything in [pulse5/shipping-with/](pulse%205/shipping-with/)

_But_, if there are any other "completed" Pulse 5 language files, they can also ship with the downloadable Pulse core files so you can select the language from the settings dropdown, without needing to come here to get the language file.

- Also use [this machine translation tool](https://ivaro.php5.sk/langs/) to get a head start!
